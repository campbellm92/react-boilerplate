## React boilerplate

This is my custom boilerplate for creating React projects.

The boilerplate contains custom components like header and footer, along with some custom hooks, for example for fetching data from APIs.

This project is constantly being added to.

# UI

Some of this project contains configuration for React-Bootstrap, a lot of it will have no UI configuration so you can decide what design frameworks you want to use.
I plan on extending UI options once I've learned more about Tailwind (for example).

# Usage

You can: copy and paste the elements you want from individual files, or

clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:campbellm92/react-boilerplate.git
```

and install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
